Hello.

My name is Samuel. I'm 23 years old and this blog is a personal effort to engage with my ideas. Like many, I've struggled to be able to concisely and consistantly describe the opinions that I subscribe to, and have struggled more with identifying why I hold them and if/why other people should too. I am hoping that through the act of writing, I can develop a relationship with my thoughts that encourages them to grow and mature, while becoming clearer to me.
